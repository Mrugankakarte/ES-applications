# Evolution Strategies

Evolution Strategies is an optimization technique based on (as name suggest) evolution. These are easier to implement as backpropogation is not required to update the policy weights. Please refer to [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/) for more details.


- MNIST Classification:
  - This folder contains the code for solving for the mnist classification problem using Evolution Strategies(ES) method. After training for 500 iterations the model get's an accuracy of 80% on test set. I plan to train the model for another 500 iterations to see if there is improvement in accuracy or not.
